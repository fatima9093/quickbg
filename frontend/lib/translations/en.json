        "q": "What are the free tier limits?",
        "a": "Anonymous users: 5 free tries without signup. Registered users: Unlimited background removal - no limits, forever free. Just create a free account after your 5 tries."
      },
      "imageFormats": {
        "q": "What image formats do you support?",
        "a": "We support all common image formats including JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP, and more. Your processed image is always exported as a high-quality PNG with transparency."
      },
      "maxImageSize": {
        "q": "What's the maximum image size?",
        "a": "You can upload images up to 10MB and 4096x4096 pixels. Our AI automatically optimizes the processing while maintaining quality."
      },
      "processingSpeed": {
        "q": "How fast is the processing?",
        "a": "Most images are processed in 2-5 seconds. We've optimized our AI model for speed without compromising quality."
      },
      "storeImages": {
        "q": "Do you store my images?",
        "a": "Absolutely not! We have a strict zero-storage policy. Your images are processed in memory and immediately deleted after you download them. We never save, store, or keep any of your images."
      },
      "dataSafe": {
        "q": "Is my data safe?",
        "a": "Yes! We use secure HTTPS connections for all uploads. Your images are processed on our servers and deleted immediately. We don't track or store any image data."
      },

        "a": "Only you! Your images are never accessible to anyone else. They're processed privately and exist only during the brief processing period."
      },
      "aiTechnology": {
        "q": "What AI technology powers QuickBG?",
        "a": "We use the ISNet AI model (isnet-general-use), which delivers professional-grade results with smooth edges and precise detail handling. It's the same quality standard used by premium background removal services."
      },
      "firstUploadSlow": {
        "q": "Why is my first upload slower?",
        "a": "The AI model is pre-warmed when our server starts, so your first upload should be just as fast! If you notice any slowness, it's likely due to network conditions."
      },
      "commercialUse": {
        "q": "Can I use QuickBG for commercial projects?",
        "a": "Yes! You can use QuickBG for personal and commercial projects. The processed images are yours to use however you like."

      },
      "uploadFailed": {
        "q": "Why did my upload fail?",

      },
      "backgroundNotRemoved": {
        "q": "The background wasn't removed correctly. Why?",

      },
      "usedAllTries": {
        "q": "I've used all my free tries. Now what?",
        "a": "Create a free account to get unlimited background removal! It takes just 30 seconds and doesn't require a credit card."
